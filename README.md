## Building & Running
### Building
To build/compile the program automatically , must be on Windows to run `./build.bat`

The libraries are not included in the repo but I have included the exact versions of each library at the end of the file.

### Running
If you built it yourself using the given batch script, the program will automatically ask if you want to run it.

If you already compiled it and want to run it, go to [the bin folder](https://github.com/wictorcode/sdl-stuff/bin)

## Libraries & External Dependencies used
I did not put the libraries inside of the project because of size issues. So here is the list of libraries used with the exact version.

The full libraries and binaries are included in the releases.

- [SDL v3.2.4 devel mingw](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.4)
- [Dear ImGui v1.91.8](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.91.8)  **(Not Currently used, but you have the compilation lines in the batch file)**
