## Building & Running
### Building
To build/compile the program automatically , you must have [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) installed on your machine as well as a C++ compiler (GNU, LLVM, etc..), and run `lua build.lua`

The result will be listed under the `./executables/` folder.

### Running
If you built it yourself using the given Lua script, the program will automatically ask if you want to run it.

If you downloaded from the releases tab, just run the `.exe`
